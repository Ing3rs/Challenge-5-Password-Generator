# Module 5 Challenge: Password Generator

## Overview

In this challenge I was required to create an application that an employee can use to generate a random password based on criteria they’ve selected.

This app should run in the browser, and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript.

It should also have a clean and polished user interface that is responsive, ensuring that it adapts to multiple screen sizes.

The password generator should: 

* Generate a password when the button is clicked
  * Present a series of prompts for password criteria
    * Length of password
      * At least 10 characters but no more than 64.
    * Character types
      * Lowercase
      * Uppercase
      * Numeric
      * Special characters ($@%&*, etc)
  * Code should validate for each input and at least one character type should be selected
  * Once prompts are answered then the password should be generated and displayed in an alert or written to the page
